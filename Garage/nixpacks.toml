# Nixpacks configuration for Render.com
# Installs Java JDK alongside Python so javac/java are available in PATH.
# 'jdk' is the stable alias in nixpkgs pointing to the current LTS (Java 21).
# Java 21 compiles Java 17 source code without any issues.
# NOTE: [phases.build].cmds is intentionally absent — render.yaml buildCommand takes precedence.

[phases.setup]
# 'jdk' is always valid in any nixpkgs channel Render uses (safe alias for latest LTS)
